# StatusCake Monitoring Infrastructure

## Monitoring Configuration Choices

Our monitoring setup has been configured with the following considerations:

### Check Intervals and Thresholds
- **Check Interval**: 5 minutes (300 seconds)
  - Rationale: Provides good balance between timely detection and resource usage
  - Frequent enough to detect issues quickly
  - Not so frequent as to create unnecessary load

- **Confirmation Count**: 3 confirmations
  - Reduces false positives by requiring multiple failed checks
  - Helps avoid alert fatigue while maintaining reliability

- **Timeout Settings**: 20 seconds
  - Chosen based on typical web application response times
  - Long enough to account for slower connections
  - Short enough to detect significant performance issues

### HTTP Check Configuration
- **SSL Validation**: Enabled
  - Ensures SSL certificates are valid
  - Critical for security monitoring

- **Status Codes**: 200, 201, 301, 302
  - Includes both successful responses and valid redirects
  - Accommodates common web application patterns

### Contact Group Setup
- Email notifications for immediate awareness
- Optional integration with Slack/Teams for team visibility
- Multiple notification channels for redundancy

## Terraform State Management Discussion

### Current Approach: Git-based State Storage
The current setup stores the Terraform state file in Git, which has several potential issues:

1. **Concurrent Access Problems**
   - Multiple team members working simultaneously can cause state conflicts
   - No built-in locking mechanism
   - Risk of state file corruption

2. **Security Concerns**
   - State files may contain sensitive information
   - All team members with repository access can see sensitive values
   - Historical sensitive data remains in Git history

3. **Scalability Issues**
   - Larger teams face more frequent merge conflicts
   - Manual intervention needed for state conflict resolution
   - Increased risk of human error

### Recommended Solutions

1. **Remote State Storage**
   - Use AWS S3 or Azure Storage for state files
   - Benefits:
     - Built-in state locking
     - Better access control
     - Improved security
     - Version history

2. **State Backend Configuration**
```hcl
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket         = "your-terraform-state"
    key            = "statuscake/terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "eu-west-1"
    encrypt        = true
    dynamodb_table = "terraform-lock"
  }
}
```

3. **Additional Security Measures**
   - Enable encryption at rest
   - Use IAM roles for access control
   - Implement state file encryption
   - Regular backup procedures

4. **Workflow Improvements**
   - Implement state locking with DynamoDB
   - Use workspaces for environment separation
   - Automated state backup procedures

This solution provides:
- Secure state storage
- Concurrent access protection
- Audit trail for changes
- Disaster recovery capabilities
